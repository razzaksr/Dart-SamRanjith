				height in cm>> to meter (h/100)
				bmi = weight/m*m
			Currency bound to indian rupee
			
			Check loan for housing loan
				income 5L and above and NoOfYearItrFiled is 4 or more
		

		Arithmetic use cases:
			1. LOA petrol bunk discount:
				get the user amount in int 
				get discount percentage in double
				subtract discount amount from given user amount
			2. GPay spiltup share:

			1. Find Billionor:
				get the networth of ambani, adani in double
				check "Is adani is rich over ambani "
			2. Ladies compartment seat allocation:
				get gender from user in String such as "male" "female" "other"
				check "can i get seat " should be true only if gender is "female"
		
		Decision Making/ Control Statements:
			to understand perform user required action based on the condition using relational and logical operators
			select one action from the many using condition
			eg:
				login into insta to perform any following actions
				1. watch reels
				2. like reels
				3. comment reels
				4. post new reel
				5. save any reel
				6. message with friend
			
			if			>> int, double, String formats data, also you can implement all types of relational and logical operators
				if(condition){
					// block of statements when condition statisfied
				}

				if(condition){
					// block of statements when condition statisfied
				}
				else{
					// block of statements when condition fails
				}

				ladder
				if(condition1){
					// block of condition1 satisfied
				}
				else if(condition2){
					// block of condition2 satisfied
				}
				.
				.
				.
				.
				.
				else{
					// block of false of all condition
				}
			switch >> only int, String formats allowed, also we cant use >,>=,<,<=, logical operators
			switch(condition){
				case : ...
				case : ....
				case :.....
				default:... if nothing matches
			}
	Task:
		1. using if else
			print you can participate in election if userage is 18 or above, otherwise print you can't participate or vote in election
		2. using if else if ... ladder
			enter the annualincome and print what is tax percentage they have to pay
			5 or less than >> no tax
			5 to 10 >> 5 percent
			10 to 15 >> 10 percent
			15 to 20 >> 20 percent
			20 to 30 >> 25 percent
			30 or above> 30 percent
			eg:
				2.5  no tax
				7.8	 5 percent tax
		3. Using switch to check theatre where user given movie running
			eg:
				Coolie	>> Divyam Cinemas
				Vikram	>> Mala Theatre
				Leo		>> Divyam Cinemas
				Kantara	>> Venkatesh Cinemas
				Maanaadu>> Mala Cinemas
				Goat	>> Prabas Cinemas
				GBU		>> Divyam Cinemas
	
	Loop Statements:
		block of codes will repeat/ recursively until the condition false

		repeatation: 
			begin			>> initialization
			step forward	>> iteration
			end				>> condition

		for: entry check
			for(init;cond;iter){
				// block to be repeated
			}
		while: entry check
			// init
			while(condition){
				// block to be repeated
				// iter
			}
		do while: exit check
		// init
		do{
			// block to be repeated
			// iter
		}while(cond);

	nested loop:
		loop1:
			loop1 logic to be repeated
			loop2:
				loop2 logic to be repeated

		eg:
			theatre single counter ticket issue
			show >> 1 to 4>> loop1
				show time
				tickets >> 1 to 300>> loop2
					get the money and issue the ticket
			
			show 1>>
				ticket 1 to 300: get the money and issue the ticket
			show 2>>
				ticket 1 to 300: get the money and issue the ticket
			show 3>>
				ticket 1 to 300: get the money and issue the ticket
			show 4>>
				ticket 1 to 300: get the money and issue the ticket
	List/ grouping:
		storage where multiple data are stored under one variable
		those multiple data are belong to same type or different
		syntax: var variable_name = []	// kart
		variable	>> all values
		values in list are located with index: starts with 0 ... size-1
		eg:
			var marks = [34,89,110,56,90,34,11,46];	>> size = 8
			index: 0 to 7
			marks[0]	>> 34
			marks[7]	>> 46
			marks[8]	>> error
	Task:
		Store 10 account balances in the list among perform following process
		1. print all account balances
		2. Add new account balance
		3. Update specific account balance using position by deposit
		4. Update specific account balance using position by withdraw
	
	Functions/ process:
		isolated block with specific logic written
		whenever we make call to that the specified logic will be executed
		reusability and avoid complexity

		definition:
		returntype nameOfTheFunction(parameters){
			// logic
			// statement
		}
		returntype>> data to be returned to the caller
		parameter >> data to be passed/ argument in order to call the function

		int, string, boolean

		call:
		nameOfTheFunction(argument)

		types:
			in built functions: add, remove, print
			user defined functions:
				variants:
					with return and with param
					with return and no param
					no return and no param
					no return and with param
		
		Task:
			create, calculate return gpa from subject grades
			create, calculate EMI and print from outstanding
		Menu/ choice based function call:
			Calculator
		Task:
			Currency Convertors:
				dollar, euro, thinar
			Number Systems:
				octal:
					repeat decimal > 0:
						decimal % 8 = append it in string
						decimal / 8 = decimal
					reverse the string and return
				Eg:
					21> decimal, str=""
					21>0:
						21%8 >> str="5"
						21/8 >> demimal = 2
					2>0:
						2%8	>> str = "52"
						2/8 >> decimal = 0
					str>> reverse>> 25
				binary:
					repeat decimal > 0:
						decimal % 2 = append it in string
						decimal / 2 = decimal
					reverse the string and return
		Task:
			find SUM/ Total value of the list using function
			find average of the list using function
				eg: 10,2,0,6	>> 4.2
			find Second maximum value in the list using function
				eg: 12,10,8,9,13	>> 12
					5,6,100,2		>> 6
